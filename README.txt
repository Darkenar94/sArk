********************************************************************************
WHAT THIS PROGRAM IS FOR:
********************************************************************************
This program has been created to offer a better way to handle the savings and
backups of the videogame ark survival evolved, as it creates backup files
of the saving in use but does not offer the possibility to use, in case the user
needs it, a previous saving while playing, and here is where this program can
come in handy, allowing the user to save time and energy when it comes to:
substituting the saving file in use with one of the backups automatically
created by the game; making copies of the entire savings folder and substituting
it with the backup itself or simply creating an additional copy of the files for
whatever personal reason.
********************************************************************************
USAGE:
********************************************************************************
As soon as launched the program will ask the user which map to work with and the
user will be able to choose by selecting the number corresponding to the map to
be used. Afterwards, it will check the location (in terms of local disk and
directory) where the game created savings and backups. At this point, it is
possible to choose one out of three options: the first will create a complete
backup, i.e. it will create a folder called 'arkBackups' on the desktop and
inside it a folder, named as the chosen map, where it will copy all the files
contained in ark survival evolved's savings folder regarding such map; the
second will substitute the saving with the user-created backup concerning the
chosen map and the third offers the possibility to substitute the saving
with one of the backups automatically created by the game.

# furthermore, the second option, before substituting the saving with the
# backup, will create a failproof folder called 'oldSaving', containing the
# saving which is about to be substituted by the backup.

in the (very unlikely) event that the saving files automatically created by the
game are not found, the program will ask the user for the exact path where they
are located and it will create a folder named 'arkBackups' on your desktop and
inside it a file named 'sArk.config' containing the current savings and backups
path, so that when the program is launched again it will not ask for the exact
path a second time.

# do not rename or move the 'arkBackups' folder and the files it contains.
